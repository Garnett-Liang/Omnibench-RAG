It was enabled through the Post-secondary Learning Act. The university is considered a \"comprehensive academic and research university\" (CARU), which means that it offers a range of academic and professional programs that generally lead to undergraduate and graduate level credentials.\nThe Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life is a research centre on the University of Alberta's Augustana Campus in Camrose, Alberta.
