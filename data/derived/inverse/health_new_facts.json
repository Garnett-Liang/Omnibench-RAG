It is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. The organisation provides care for diabetes, drug-resistant infections, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, tropical and neglected diseases, tuberculosis, vaccines and COVID-19. In 2019, the charity was active in 70 countries with over 35,000 personnel; mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers, and administrators. Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63\u00a0billion.\nThe Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines is an international campaign started by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) to increase the availability of essential medicines in developing countries. MSF often has difficulties treating patients because the medicines required are too expensive or are no longer produced. Sometimes, the only drugs available are highly toxic or ineffective, and they often have to resort to inadequate testing methods to diagnose patients.",

Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists. Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology.

The camp was a blend of three key aspects: free extensive cardiac health checkups, the largest heart health research, and widespread awareness of cardiovascular health. It was conducted to raise awareness about cardiovascular diseases and also conduct research on the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in apparently healthy-looking adults of the Kathmandu Valley. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Nepal Health Research Council (JNHRC), and the research was recognized with the \"Best Research Paper\" award of 2018.",
