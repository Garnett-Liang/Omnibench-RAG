        "description": "In Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths are \"the truths of the noble one ,\" a statement of how things really are when they are seen correctly. The four truths aredukkha. Dukkha is an innate characteristic of transient existence; nothing is forever, this is painful;\nsamudaya : together with this transient world and its pain, there is also thirst, craving for and attachment to this transient, unsatisfactory existence;\nnirodha : the attachment to this transient world and its pain can be severed or contained by the confinement or letting go of this craving;\nmarga : the Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the confinement of this desire and attachment, and the release from dukkha.\nThe Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopaedic Dictionary is a comprehensive multi-volume encyclopaedia in Russian. It contains 121,240 articles, 7,800 images, and 235 maps. It was published in the Russian Empire in 1890\u20131907, as a joint venture of Leipzig and St Petersburg publishers. The articles were written by the prominent Russian scholars of the period, such as Dmitri Mendeleev and Vladimir Solovyov. Reprints have appeared following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.",

Dukkha is an innate characteristic of transient existence; nothing is forever, this is painful;\nsamudaya : together with this transient world and its pain, there is also thirst, craving for and attachment to this transient, unsatisfactory existence;\nnirodha : the attachment to this transient world and its pain can be severed or contained by the confinement or letting go of this craving;\nmarga : the Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the confinement of this desire and attachment, and the release from dukkha.\nThe Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopaedic Dictionary is a comprehensive multi-volume encyclopaedia in Russian. It contains 121,240 articles, 7,800 images, and 235 maps. It was published in the Russian Empire in 1890\u20131907, as a joint venture of Leipzig and St Petersburg publishers. The articles were written by the prominent Russian scholars of the period, such as Dmitri Mendeleev and Vladimir Solovyov. Reprints have appeared following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.",

Dukkha is an innate characteristic of transient existence; nothing is forever, this is painful;\nsamudaya : together with this transient world and its pain, there is also thirst, craving for and attachment to this transient, unsatisfactory existence;\nnirodha : the attachment to this transient world and its pain can be severed or contained by the confinement or letting go of this craving;\nmarga : the Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the confinement of this desire and attachment, and the release from dukkha.\nThe Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopaedic Dictionary is a comprehensive multi-volume encyclopaedia in Russian. It contains 121,240 articles, 7,800 images, and 235 maps. It was published in the Russian Empire in 1890\u20131907, as a joint venture of Leipzig and St Petersburg publishers. The articles were written by the prominent Russian scholars of the period, such as Dmitri Mendeleev and Vladimir Solovyov. Reprints have appeared following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.",

Dukkha is an innate characteristic of transient existence; nothing is forever, this is painful;\nsamudaya : together with this transient world and its pain, there is also thirst, craving for and attachment to this transient, unsatisfactory existence;\nnirodha : the attachment to this transient world and its pain can be severed or contained by the confinement or letting go of this craving;\nmarga : the Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the confinement of this desire and attachment, and the release from dukkha.\nThe Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopaedic Dictionary is a comprehensive multi-volume encyclopaedia in Russian. It contains 121,240 articles, 7,800 images, and 235 maps. It was published in the Russian Empire in 1890\u20131907, as a joint venture of Leipzig and St Petersburg publishers. The articles were written by the prominent Russian scholars of the period, such as Dmitri Mendeleev and Vladimir Solovyov. Reprints have appeared following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.",
