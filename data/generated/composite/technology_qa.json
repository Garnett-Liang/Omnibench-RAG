The term was coined by Peter Harper, one of the founders of the Centre for Alternative Technology, North Wales, in Undercurrents (magazine) in the 1970s. Alternative Technologies are created to be safer, cleaner, and overall more efficient. The goals of alternative technology are to decrease demand for critical elements by ensuring a secure supply of technology that is environmentally friendly, increased efficiency with lower costs, and with more common materials to avoid potential future materials crises. Alternative technologies use renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind energy. Some alternative technologies have in the past or may in the future become widely adopted, after which they might no longer be considered \"alternative.\" For example, the use of wind turbines to produce electricity.",

Animal technology is one of the recognized professional areas held by registered science technicians, and animal technologists, also called animal technicians, play a key role in supporting biomedical research by ensuring that animals are available for study. Principal areas of animal technology include animal husbandry and breeding, providing day-to-day care for laboratory animals, ensuring compliance with animal welfare practices and legal issues and performing essential scientific procedures. Technical qualifications for animal technologists and the regulations they must adhere to vary by country, but in many parts of the world animal technology is a highly structured profession that forms part of laboratory management. Animal technology is related to the field of animal management and technologists are often specialize in working with particular species of animals, either in the laboratory or in the field.",

It is a component of architecture and building engineering and is sometimes viewed as a distinct discipline or sub-category. New materials and technologies generated new design challenges and construction methods throughout the evolution of building, especially since the advent of industrialisation in the 19th century. Architectural technology is related to the different elements of a building and their interactions; it is closely aligned with advances in building science.",

It can be defined as either the most complex or the newest technology on the market. The opposite of high tech is low technology, referring to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology; for example, a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device. When high tech becomes old, it becomes low tech, for example vacuum tube electronics. Further, high tech is related to the concept of mid-tech, that is a balance between the two opposite extreme qualities of low-tech and high tech. Mid-tech could be understood as an inclusive middle that combines the efficiency and versatility of digital/automated technology with low-tech's potential for autonomy and resilience.",
